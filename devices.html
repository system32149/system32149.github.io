        <h2>Samsung Galaxy A02</h2>
        <b>CPU:</b> MT6739W<br />
        <b>RAM:</b> 3 GB<br />
        <b>Disk space:</b> 32 GB<br />
        <b>Display:</b> 720x1600 (PLS) LCD<br />
        <b>Operating system:</b> Android 11 (One UI Core 3.1)<br />
        <b>Other:</b> Dual SIM<br />
        <b>Comments:</b> This phone shouldn't exist. The specs look like its from an e-waste phone like some Infinix that runs Android Go. Sometimes the phone becomes unstable and i have to do that "Device care" thing. I did everything to optimize this phone. I can't even install a custom ROM on it since it uses a Mediatek SoC. and worst of all, i use it as a daily driver.
